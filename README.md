This is a smart recipe generator built with **React.js** and **Vite**, connected to a text-generation **API**.  
Users can enter a list of ingredients, and the app will generate a custom recipe based on the provided inputs.

## Features

- Uses modern **JavaScript (ES6)** syntax
- Integrated with an AI-powered text-generation API
- Users can input available ingredients
- Generates a detailed recipe with instructions
- Clean, responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- Handles API requests and renders results dynamically
